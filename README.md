## Set Up

In order for our project to be functional on your machine, you must install all the necessary packages. In our project directory, we have a client folder and a server folder. In your IDE, use 2 terminals - one for each folder. In each terminal, cd into each of the folders. In the client folder, install the following packages:

# npm i @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
# npm i @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons
# npm i @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons
# npm i @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
# npm i @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
# npm i @fullcalendar/daygrid
# npm i @fullcalendar/react
# npm i @fullcalendar/timegrid
# npm i @testing-library/jest-dom
# npm i @testing-library/react
# npm i @testing-library/user-event
# npm i axios
# npm i bootstrap
# npm i express
# npm i mobx
# npm i mobx-react
# npm i react
# npm i react-bootstrap
# npm i react-dom
# npm i react-router
# npm i react-router-bootstrap
# npm i react-router-dom
# npm i react-scripts
# npm i react-select-datepicker
# npm i web-vitals

Then, run the following command:

## `npm start`

This command runs the app in the development mode.\
Although the page should automatically open, you can also open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

In your server folder, first install the following packages:

# npm i axios
# npm i bcrypt
# npm i cors
# npm i express
# npm i express-mysql-session
# npm i express-session
# npm i express.js
# npm i mysql
# npm i react-scripts


Then, run the following command:

## `node index.js`

This command runs backend of the app.\
This page will likely not open autamatically. Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser. 

Now, the app should be fully running and navigable.
